_In advanced economies, public firms play an important role in sectors of general interest such as energy and water supply. The conditions under which they operate in the EU have changed fundamentally since 1998, with new strategies required for firms to preserve market shares in the face of liberalization and technological innovation. The paper investigates the impact of reorganization on productivity within public firms addressing the owners' composition, the board-management relationship, and the management's decision to outsource activities. Considering a large panel of 2,325 German municipally-owned firms between 2003 and 2014, this study estimates firm-level productivity based on a control function approach. Contrary to public choice theory, I do not find support for the hypothesis that an increase in government owners' control over the firm, either through shares or the board's control rights, decreases productivity. Looking at reorganization invoked by the management, I find that outsourcing increases productivity, where effects are strongest for service outsourcing._

The empirical analysis was done in `R`. In this repository you find all statistical programs necessary to conduct the analyses in the paper. See [here](https://gitlab.com/modern-state-owned-firms) for more information on the data sources and the linkage strategy to merge all the data sources.

The research was funded by the Leibniz Association and the German Science Foundation while I was an investigator in the research projects "Kommunale Infrastrukturunternehmen zwischen Energiewende und demographischem Wandel" (2013-2016) and [Modern State-Owned Firms - An Empirical Analysis of Market Power, Productivity, and Innovation](https://modern-state-owned-firms.gitlab.io/landing-page) (2019-2022) at DIW Berlin.
